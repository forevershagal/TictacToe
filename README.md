# Tic Tac Toe in Java

## Overview
This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic Tac Toe, developed using Java. The game allows two players to compete against each other in a grid-based format.

## Features
- Two-player mode
- Console-based interface
- Input validation for moves
- Display of the game board after each turn
- Win condition check

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher installed on your machine.

### Installation
Clone the repository: https://github.com/forevershagal/TictacToe
   

## How to Play
1. Players take turns to place their mark (X or O) in an empty cell.
2. The first player to get three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
3. If all cells are filled and no player has three in a row, the game ends in a draw.
